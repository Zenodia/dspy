The pairing of chromosomes, segregation of alleles, and separation of chromatids are all significant events during meiosis that contribute to genetic variation. However, the event that contributes most to variation is the segregation of alleles during meiosis I, which involves the independent assortment of homologous chromosomes, creating new combinations of alleles in each gamete. The creation of haploid gametes and the separation of chromatids are important steps in meiosis, but they do not directly contribute to the variation between gametes. False\n",
